#  Severance Terminal

Inspired by the unsettling world of **Severance (Apple TV+)**, this project recreates the iconic terminal interface with **floating numbers**—a visual nod to the mysterious data refinement work of Lumon Industries.

> “We’re all different people at work.”  
> — Severance


## 🧠 Concept

This project is a creative exploration of a fictional data-sorting terminal like the ones used by the *Macrodata Refinement* team. The UI is minimalist, eerie, and hypnotic—numbers float, shift, and sometimes react, echoing the surreal disconnection of severed consciousness.
### Key Features (in progress)
- [x] Terminal-style interface (retro CRT-inspired)
- [x] Randomly floating/moving digits (Matrix-style meets Severance)
- [ ] Interactive mode (planned)
- [ ] Sound FX toggle (planned)
- [ ] Secret triggers & easter eggs (planned)


## 🚧 Project Status

This project is actively in development. Expect glitches, placeholder visuals, and minimal interaction—for now.


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React – Component-based UI for modular structure
- Styled Components – Scoped styling using tagged template literals
- JavaScript (ES6+) – Core logic and interaction


## 🧩 Inspiration

- *Severance* by Dan Erickson  
- CRT terminals / retrofuturism  
- Experimental UI / artful discomfort 


## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This is a fan-made project with no affiliation to Apple, Severance, or Lumon Industries. Just an admirer of good sci-fi.
